Today is the day I learned what Git and GitHub is. Apparantly those are some fundamentals in coding. So by the time I finish the OdinProject I will come back to this to see how much I progressed. I hope I finish this somtime in my junior year. I want to be equals with my brother in this field of coding, but with a lot of time, effort, and google-ing I will be on par with my brother. And we might even work together one day but one thing is certain! We will live together in some high rise apartment may it be in Manhattan or maybe Singapore.
Goodluck Fayoz! Don't give up so one day you can come back to this and smile cause all of what you hoped for came true.
